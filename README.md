# OddsJam Enhancer

The OddsJam Enhancer is a chrome extension designed improve the
usability of the OddsJam website.

## Mark Pinny

The OddsJam Enhancer can be set to show a "Mark Pinny" button at
the top of the screen. This button will highlight rows that have
Pinnacle odds for one of the lines. The intent is to call out
arbitrage rows that are arbs to Pinnacle. In such cases the play
is on the opposing line, as Pinnacle has long term proof as the
sharper book. This ability can be turned on/off on the options
page.

## Icon Links

The OddsJam Enhancer intercepts clicks on the sportsbook links
that OddsJam shows when showing best lines. These intercepted
clicks attempt to send the user to the page where the user can
place the bet. The page is opened according to the target setting
on the options page.
