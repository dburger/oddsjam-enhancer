# OddsJam Enhancer

The OddsJam Enhancer is a chrome extension designed improve the
usability of the OddsJam website.

## Mark Pinny

The OddsJam Enhancer can be set to show a "Mark Pinny" button at
the top of the screen. It can also be activated by pressing
CTRL-m. This will highlight rows that have Pinnacle odds for one
of the lines. The intent is to use this on the arbitrage page to
quickly call out arbitrage rows that are arbs to Pinnacle. In such
cases the play is on the opposing line, as Pinnacle has long term
proof as the sharper book.

## Icon Links

The OddsJam Enhancer intercepts clicks on the sportsbook links
that OddsJam shows when showing best lines. These intercepted
clicks attempt to send the user to the page where the user can
place the bet. The page is opened according to the target setting
on the options page.
